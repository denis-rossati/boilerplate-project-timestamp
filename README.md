# [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice)

This is one of the five projects of the back-end course from free code camp.

---

## What the app does?

There are only two routes in the app: '/api' and '/api/timestamp', where "timestamp" can be or a string in unix time or a date.

## How can I run the app?

You can run either `npm start` or `npm run dev` after you download the repo and install your dependencies. Then you can use the tool `postman` to test the routes locally. For example:

`http://localhost:3000/api/1451001600000`

(or you can run in the chrome, it'll work too :P)

In the future I'll deploy it, but not today. Have no money and my accounts in free deploy plataforms reached the max amount of apps :(

### Challenges that I had during the development

I'm not used to work with dates XD. This was not a big challenge, but some research was maded and I learned a lot :)
